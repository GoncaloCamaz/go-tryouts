# go-tryouts

I created this repository to start learning a new language. After asking from some initial advice, i started by following a tutorial from https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests.
This website provided a quick start guide about the language and some of its qwerks. I also complemented the guide with some videos from youtube channels like freeCodeCamp, Learn to Code and Anthony GG.

After following the first steps and asking the copilot for some example exercises, I started a review of some important algorithms present in the algorithms folder to go through binary trees,
graphs and some sorting methods to apply with slices.

Following the development of the algorithms, I started looking for courses to learn/remmeber a bit more about concurrency and for that, I bought some courses in Udemy.
