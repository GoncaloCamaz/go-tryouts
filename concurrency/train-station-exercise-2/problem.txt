As we learned in the exercise number 1, the implemented solution only works fine with one passenger.
Thats because channels do not broadcast to every go routine listening.

Therefore, in this exercise I will try to implement some sort of broadcast server or implement the 
observer pattern.

In the folder broadcast-server-example, I have tested a solution that i found to broadcast to every go routine from:
https://betterprogramming.pub/how-to-broadcast-messages-in-go-using-channels-b68f42bdf32e

For the train example, i will implement a similar solution but with some small namming differences. To better understand how the 
broadcast server works, I will call the broadcast server the TrainPositionReport app where I will mock a scenario where the passengers
received a notification in their phone that the train has arrived to a certain station. They can choose to board or not if the train will
go to the station that the passenger wants to go.
